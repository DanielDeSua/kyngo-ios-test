# Welcome future Kyngo iOS Developer!

This is a super fun and exciting<sup>*</sup> challenge for you. You have 4 hours to complete this from the time you start. Good luck!

0. Fork [this project](https://github.com/kyngoadmin/kyngo-node-test)!

1. Add a UINavigationController with an embedded UITableViewController

2. Populate the UITableViewController with a list of albums from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums
  * Each item should just include the title

3. When the user taps on an album, it should cause a navigation to another list containing the photos in the selected album
  * Each item should contain the title and a thumbnail image

4. A photo selection should navigate to a more detailed page containing more photo information:
  * This page should show the photo title and its full image

5. Make a pull request with your changes.

## Bonus points (if you have time):
  * Add a delete option for photos and albums
  * Be able to edit photo and album titles
  * Make a tabbed interface containing the above UINavigationController as well as a tab for the current user information (name, email, address, etc.)
